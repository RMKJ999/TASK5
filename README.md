# TASK5
Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. 
I developed an innovative model capable of recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content. 🍔📸✨

Here’s what I accomplished:

Data Preparation: Utilized the Food-101 dataset, preprocessing images and incorporating calorie information for accurate model training. 📂

Model Development: Built two models:

Food Item Recognition: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify various food items. 🍕🥗

Calorie Estimation: A regression model to estimate calorie content from images. 🔢

Training & Evaluation: Trained the models and evaluated their performance, achieving notable accuracy and regression metrics. 📈

Visualization: Analyzed training history to optimize model performance. 📉

This project enhanced my skills in deep learning and computer vision, and I’m grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for this amazing opportunity! 🙌
